                        <p>
                          Students understand how migration has shaped
                          Australian cuisine and recognise the fusion of
                          traditional and contemporary food practices. They
                          analyse cultural influences on cooking techniques,
                          discuss family food traditions, and reflect on how
                          global migration affects personal eating habits.
