                    <p>My name is <strong>Gemma Watson</strong> and I am a Pre-Service teacher studying at the <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au" target="_blank">Australian Catholic University.</a></p>
                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p>
                    My name is <strong>Gemma Watson</strong> and I am currently studying a <strong>Bachelor of Education (Secondary) and a Bachelor of Design and Innovation Technologies,</strong> specialising in <strong>Textiles, Food Technology, and Computing,</strong> which are part of the NESA curriculum, <a href="https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/tas">Nesa Syllabus</a>. I have always loved working with my hands, creating unique designs, and exploring how technology can be used creatively. My background as a high-level gymnast taught me discipline, focus, and resilience, which I now bring into the classroom. This experience shaped who I am and sparked my interest in helping others discover their own passions through learning. I believe education should be engaging, empowering, and inclusive for every student.</p>
                    <p>
                    As a pre-service teacher, I am passionate about <strong>creating safe, supportive spaces</strong> where students feel <em>seen, challenged, and inspired.</em> My lessons are interactive and hands-on, often blending design thinking, real-world contexts, and opportunities for creativity. I especially enjoy teaching in project-based subjects like Design and Technology, where students can see their ideas come to life. I'm also committed to making learning accessible for diverse learners, including those who are EAL/D or need additional support. I want students to leave my classroom feeling capable and confident, not just in what they know, but in who they are becoming.</p>
